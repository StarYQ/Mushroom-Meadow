# Mushroom-Meadow

## Overview

*Mushroom Meadow* is a nature-themed twist on the classic Minesweeper game. In this game, you become a peaceful forest forager collecting **edible mushrooms** while avoiding **toxic toadstools**. Each safe click brings you closer to winning, but one wrong move (clicking on a toxic toadstool) ends the game immediately.

## How to Play

1. **Start Game:**  
   When the game loads, you will see a grid of covered cells that represent a meadow.

2. **Reveal a Cell:**  
   - **Left-Click** on a cell to reveal it.
   - If the cell is safe, you will see a number indicating how many neighboring cells (adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) contain toxic toadstools.
   - If the cell is toxic, you'll see a toxic indicator and the game ends immediately.

3. **Flag Suspicious Cells:**  
   - **Right-Click** on an unrevealed cell to mark it with a twig flag (ðŸªµ).
   - Use flags to keep track of cells you suspect might contain toxic toadstools, preventing accidental clicks.

4. **Win the Game:**  
   - Reveal all safe cells (i.e., all edible mushrooms) without clicking on any toxic toadstools.
   - When all safe mushrooms are collected, you win the game and see a victory message.

5. **Restart the Game:**  
   - Click the **Restart Game** button to clear the board and start a new round.

|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Edible Mushrooms**       | Safe cells that you want to reveal.                                             |
| **Toxic Toadstools**       | The hidden mines that, if revealed, will end the game.                          |
| **Mushroom Spore Clues**   | Numbers on safe cells that tell you how many neighboring cells contain toxins.  |
| **Twig Flags**             | Marks placed by right-clicking to indicate suspected toxic toadstools.           |

## Tips for Playing

- **Plan Your Moves:**  
  Use the mushroom spore clues (numbers) on revealed cells to deduce where toxic toadstools might be hiding.

- **Flag Wisely:**  
  Mark cells that you suspect are toxic using right-click. This helps avoid accidentally clicking those cells later.

- **Think Ahead:**  
  The more safe cells you reveal, the more information you have to make informed decisions about the remaining covered cells.

Enjoy foraging safely in Mushroom Meadow!
